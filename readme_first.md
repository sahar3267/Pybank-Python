# Basic Breakdown
### Note: Instructions for the required assignment are in the folder called "Instructions"

There are two folders here: "Instructions" and "Extra Content". The "Instructions" directory contains two folders: "PyBank" and "PyPoll". The only requirement for this homework is to complete one of these assignments. You can do both if you'd like extra practice. The 2nd folder, "Extra Content", contains two assignments that are 100% optional: "PyBoss" and "PyParagraph". You are not required to complete either of these, but they do provide some good practice.

### In short:
PyBank and PyPoll = Choose one, only one is required.  
PyBoss and PyParagraph = completely optional.

### What to turn in: 
A folder containing the Python file and any output files generated by the Python program.

### What we grade on:
1. Does it run? This is the main thing for this first python assignment. <br>2. Code readability - Proper formatting / good variable names / comments <br>3. Are the answers correct? For the first Python assignment, this one is less important. This one is more about creating a functioning program and learning how to write python than getting every answer exactly right.
